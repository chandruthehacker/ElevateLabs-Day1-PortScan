## 📋 Overview  
Performed network reconnaissance using Nmap and Wireshark to identify active hosts, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities in the local network (192.168.203.0/24).  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Identify live hosts and network topology  
- Detect open ports and running services  
- Fingerprint operating systems  
- Analyze scan traffic patterns  
- Assess security risks  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
| Tool | Purpose | Command Examples |  
|------|---------|------------------|  
| Zenmap | Network scanning | `nmap -sS 192.168.203.0/24` |  
| Wireshark | Traffic analysis | `tcp.flags.syn==1` filter |  



## 📌 Key Findings  
### Host Discovery  
- **192.168.203.157**: Windows PC (SMB, RPC open)  
- **192.168.203.36**: Android device (DNS open)  
- **192.168.203.93**: Realme mobile device  

### Open Ports
**157:**
- 135/tcp - Microsoft RPC
- 139/tcp - NetBIOS
- 445/tcp - SMB
- 16001/tcp - Unknown

**36:**
- 53/tcp - dnsmasq 2.51



## ⚠️ Identified Risks  
1. **SMB Exposure (Port 445)**  
   - Risk: Critical (WannaCry vulnerability)  
   - Recommendation: Disable SMBv1 immediately  

2. **Outdated dnsmasq (Port 53)**  
   - Risk: High (CVE-2017-14491)  
   - Recommendation: Update to latest version  

3. **NetBIOS (Port 139)**  
   - Risk: Medium (Information disclosure)  
   - Recommendation: Restrict to internal network  



## 📊 Wireshark Analysis  
- Captured 500+ SYN packets during scan  
- Verified TCP 3-way handshake patterns  
- Identified scan timing characteristics  



## 🔧 Mitigation Steps  
```bash  
# Windows SMB hardening:  
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb1protocol  

# Firewall rule example:  
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 445 -j DROP
```

## 🧠 Interview Q&A

1. **What is an open port?**  
   A network port that is actively accepting connections. Indicates a service is running.

2. **How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?**  
   It sends SYN packets to target ports and waits for SYN-ACK responses. If SYN-ACK is received, the port is open. This is known as a "half-open scan" because the connection is never completed.

3. **What are the risks of open ports?**  
   Attackers can exploit services running on open ports. For example, SMB (port 445) was targeted by the WannaCry ransomware.

4. **What is the difference between TCP and UDP scans?**  
   - **TCP scan**: Establishes a connection or partial connection; more reliable and detectable.  
   - **UDP scan**: Connectionless; harder to detect but slower and less reliable due to lack of responses.

5. **How can open ports be secured?**  
   - Use firewalls to restrict access.  
   - Disable unused services.  
   - Apply security patches regularly.  
   - Use techniques like port-knocking for stealth.

6. **What is the firewall’s role?**  
   A firewall controls incoming and outgoing traffic, blocks unwanted connections, and limits which services are exposed to a network.

7. **Why do attackers scan ports?**  
   To identify active services, detect vulnerabilities, and map out a network before launching an attack.

8. **What is Wireshark’s role in port scanning?**  
   It captures and visualizes network traffic, allowing analysis of how Nmap scans work (e.g., SYN packets and responses). It helps verify scan behavior and network reactions.
